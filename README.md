# NOTE: 

To execute this code successfully, you need to replace the placeholder API keys with actual valid keys. Additionally, you need to enable "less secure apps" on your Gmail account or use an app password (if you have two-factor authentication enabled) to allow the script to send emails via the Gmail SMTP server.

Please be cautious while using real API keys and email credentials, and ensure you follow the terms of service of the API providers.
